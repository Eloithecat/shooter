get angle from derval trajected trajectory

palette swap


use
class A:
    def __init__(self, **kwargs):
        self.__dict__.update(kwargs)


user can set keys and buttons/axis (as windows has different keys :/
so make a menu
and new scenes with levels as parameters...
and describe waves of enemies in level (at time, or waiting for event)
wave : enemy type, nb of enemies, trajectories, init positions

weapon object
link player keys , projectile maps, and ships weapons...


??use pygame rect object for collisions

bug of keyboard layout (use event.unicode  ??

idea: one thread for positions, instanciations, one thread for drawing
instantiator in scene to uniformize instanciation and split entity

TENTACLE BOSS !!
